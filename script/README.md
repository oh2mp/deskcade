## Usable scripts for setup.

# stripxml.pl
 - Strips extraneous data from **advmame.xml** and leaves only data for roms that you have. It speeds advmenu startup a lot if you don't have many games.

# joy.pl
 - This script prints out joystick data for **util/var/volume.pl** if there is need to edit the joystick codes.
