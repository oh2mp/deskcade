**raspberrypi_defconfig** is config how the buildroot image was created with my hardware.
That config file is for buildroot 2017.2.7 that can be downloaded from [https://buildroot.org/downloads/](https://buildroot.org/downloads/) and it might not work with other versions.
Edit the file and set the right path to your buildroot directory,save it as *.config* there and then just run make.

**ROOT** contains some trees containing example files for splash image, inittab etc.
